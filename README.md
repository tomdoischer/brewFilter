# brewFilter
A small app for Android to calculate the amount of coffee or water to brew coffee with Hario V60.

There are two options:
  you know how much coffee you have and need to find out how much water you should use
  you want to prepare a certain amount of coffee (which is great if there's only so much in the bag)
  
You can choose from three different strenghts of coffee: mild (18 ml of water per gram of coffee), standard (13 ml of water per gram of coffee), strong (8 ml of water per gram of coffee). I prefer the strong option, mild would result in a watery mess (though some might prefer that the flavor is easier to read), but hey, who am I to judge you! 

The code is very simple and probably no comments are necessary but they are there.
